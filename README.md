# Label Propagation via Diffusion on a Graph

This repository contains an implementation of the semi-supervised learning algorithm presented in [[Zhu et. al, 2003]](https://cdn.aaai.org/ICML/2003/ICML03-118.pdf). Given a classification problem with very little labelled data, the algorithm allows to propagate the known labels by exploiting the geometric structure of the data.

The code was developed for the course "Statistical Machine Learning" at EPFL in the academic year 2023-2024, fall semester.
